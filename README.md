# password_generator

## Description
My motivation for this project was to create a functional passoword generator that is user friendly and easy to navigate. What I learned from this project is how to write functions that verifys user inputs as well as record user input and generate a password based on their input. This project also motivated me to look into how a user could copy the generated code. That however is not available in this project.
